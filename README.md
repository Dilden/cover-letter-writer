# Cover Letter Writer

This is a very simple and crude web app for generating cover letters using an LLM.

## Requirements

+ Node & npm
+ [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (or some other API based LLM)


## Getting Started

1. clone/fork this repo
2. run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. start your Ollama LLM (`ollama run YOUR_MODEL`)
4. run `npm run dev` to start the web server
5. edit `src/lib/resume.ts` with your info
6. navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to start dumping job descriptions in and getting nonsense back from an LLM


## Disclaimers
+ LLMs are probably bad for like, everything
+ this was for fun
+ don't complain to me if you don't get a job
+ don't complain to me if you *do* get a job
